Jenkins is currently being used by open source teams in my organization as their Continuous Integration solution. Coming from a Microsoft-centric team, we rely more on MSBuild/TFS Build Server and Visual Studio Release Management to do this for us. I wondered, though, if we could use Jenkins for MS projects instead, which would allow our organization to maybe focus on just one tool and cater to a wide range of projects. My goal was to build a pipeline from Visual Studio going into GitLab for source control and then moving into Jenkins for continuous integration, scheduled builds, and all that jazz. Here's my adventure.

I've been using Visual Studio and GitLab for a while now so my development machine is already properly configured to use both. I just needed to install and configure Jenkins and I'd be all set. So I downloaded it from the [Jenkins site] (https://jenkins-ci.org/), which thankfully provides a native Windows Package. It offered a no-fuss installation, and within Minutes, Jenkins was up and running. So far so good.

Next, I needed to teach Jenkins how to build Microsoft .NET solutions. A quick Google search informed me that there's already an MSBuild plugin available for Jenkins.
